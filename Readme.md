Finding Similar Data in News Category Dataset
This project is designed to help users find the most similar data to a given input from the News Category Dataset, using four different similarity algorithms. The project also includes a model that can be trained to predict the most similar data to a given input.

Dataset
The News Category Dataset is available on Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-category-dataset. 

The dataset contains over 200,000 news articles from 2012 to 2018, and includes the following columns:

- category: the category of the news article
- headline: the headline of the news article
- authors: the authors of the news article
- link: a link to the news article
- short_description: a short summary of the news article

Similarity Algorithms
We use four different similarity algorithms to find the most similar data to a given input:

- Cosine similarity
- Jaccard similarity
- Euclidean distance
- Manhattan distance
Each algorithm is implemented using Python and the scikit-learn library.
